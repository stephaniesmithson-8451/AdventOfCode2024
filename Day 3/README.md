# Day 3: Java

Ahh Java, what a throwback! Considering the fact that Java was the first programming language I learned, this one definitely hit a soft spot for me. Getting to use BufferedReader and FileReader objects again took me back high school/college coursework in the best kind of way. It's fun to see how much I've grown from then to now in my approach to problems like these. Those pesky regular expressions still gave me some trouble but nothing Oracle docs couldn't help with :)
