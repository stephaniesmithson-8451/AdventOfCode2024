# Day 2: C++

Coming to C++ land after years in Python world is a bit jarring to say the least. I ran into some similar hiccups here from Day 1 and took some time to get comfortable with data types and loops. Today's challenge had to do with parsing ordered lists of integers and determining if the lists were passing or not based on rules (https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2).

At first I attempted a recursive solution that was giving me some issues resulting in too many passing reports, but found success when I moved that logic to my main function and handled the 'Problem Dampener' cases there instead. This was a fun one if you don't count the amount of if/else statements I relied on to make it work!
