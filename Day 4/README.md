# Day 4: C#

C# is an interesting language with lots of similarities to Java and C++, I found this syntax came much more naturally to me after yesterday's challenge. If I opted for a different data structure like a matrix the verbosity of this program would be significantly improved, and I'd like to revisit this one down the line with a goal of reducing this file by 50 lines.

Aside from this being one of the ugliest solutions I've produced to this point, it's fun to work with extremely stripped down OOP languages every once in a while and I'm excited to have had the opportunity. Though I'm biased, I'll continue to represent Java in the Java vs C# debate (thanks AP Computer Science!).
